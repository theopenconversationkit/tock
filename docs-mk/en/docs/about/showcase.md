Among them, some of the [TOSIT](http://tosit.fr/) companies - not only [SNCF](https://www.sncf.com/).

Sometimes these applications are not dedicated to public usage and their organization will not communicate
about them. We will mention them here when it is possible :)

By the way, do not hesitate to look at the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/tockchat/Lobby) 
community chat to see professionals, students, large and smaller companies
 currently using or experimenting with Tock for their conversational or _NLU_ projects.
