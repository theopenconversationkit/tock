This page presents the aspects related to the use of _Cloud_ services (private or public) to deploy
and host Tock platforms and bots.

Indeed, we have experience of using Tock in production on classic _on-premise_ and _bare metal_ hosting, but also on _private Clouds_ like [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) or _public Clouds_
like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

> Coming soon: details, examples and feedback on the use of Tock on _Cloud_ type hosting. We even hope to be able to share with the code community: _infra as code_, dashboards, etc.
