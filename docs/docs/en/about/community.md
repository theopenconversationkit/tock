## TOSIT association

The Tock solution is currently being assessed by the _TOSIT (The Open Source I Trust)_,
 an association dedicated to support Open Source and Free Software, as part of the _Chatbots_ Work Group.

> Founded by Carrefour, EDF, Enedis, Orange, Pôle Emploi and SNCF, TOSIT now gathers other important members,
>such as the (French) Ministère des Armées, Société Générale or MAIF.

Several TOSIT members, including SNCF, already use or experiment Tock.

To know more about TOSIT, please visit [http://tosit.fr/](http://tosit.fr/)

## Public Demo hosting

The public Live Demo helps newcomers try and experiment with the solution. A dedicated user guide is available 
to make one's first steps with Tock and bots.
Thanks to [e.Voyageurs SNCF](https://www.sncf.com/fr/groupe/newsroom/e-voyageurs-sncf) for hosting and maintaining the 
public Live Demo platform.
