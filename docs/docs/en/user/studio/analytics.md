# The *Analytics* menu

This menu contains a series of tabs to view and analyze the bot's use cases, configurations, stories, and intentions.

The _Monitoring_ menu allows you to track and observe connected users and conversations.

## The *Activity* tab

This screen allows you to track different indicators over time:

* Number of messages received by the bot
* Messages per Story,
* Messages per Configuration,
* Messages per Connector,
* Etc.

A calendar allows you to define the time period to be viewed.

Each indicator can be viewed in several ways:

* Histogram
* Pie chart (over the selected period)
* ​​Sortable table
* CSV export

The _Preferences_ tab allows you to create your own dashboard, choose your indicators, and presentation options.

## The *Behavior* tab

This screen presents other indicators for a defined period, without representing their evolution:

* Type of messages received by the bot
* Most used channels
* Hourly traffic
* Traffic by day of the week
* Etc.

A calendar allows you to define the period of time to be viewed.

Each indicator can be viewed in several ways:

* Pie chart (over the selected period)

The _Preferences_ tab allows you to compose your own dashboard, choose your indicators and presentation options.

## The *Flow* tab

This screen allows you to analyze the _flow_ of intentions and conversations:

* Conversation flow (_Dynamic_ / _User Flow_): dynamic analysis of the paths actually taken by users

* Intention flow (_Static_ / _Available Stories_): static analysis of the paths and decision trees proposed by the bot

By expanding the interface (arrow to the right of the frame), many filters appear: focus on an intention, incoming/outgoing transitions, all transitions or only the most representative in terms of traffic, etc.

## The _Users_ tab

This tab allows you to see the last users connected to the bot:

* Number of connected users
* Date of the last exchange with a user
* Last message sent
* Etc.

By clicking on _Display dialog_, you can see this user's conversation.

## The *Search* tab

Like the _Users_ view, this screen allows you to observe the latest conversations.

It is possible to filter them by connector, intention, etc.

## The *Preferences* tab

This screen allows you to configure the dashboards of the _Activity_ and _Behavior_ views, both the indicators/graphs to display but also different presentation options:
3D diagrams, curve smoothing, etc.

An action allows the user to save their preferences.
