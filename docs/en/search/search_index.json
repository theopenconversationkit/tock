Declaring Entities \u00b6 If necessary, you can specify the entities of this new intent, by selecting the text of these entities, and then clicking on the \"Add New Entity\" button that has just appeared. It's up to you to choose an existing entity type, or create a new one, and then give that entity a role. Built-in Entities \u00b6 In the window \"Add Entity\", you can see that there are already pre-existing entities (prefixed by duckling ). These are the entities recognized by the eponymous library. These entities will be recognized and valued automatically if you specify them in at least one sentence of the intent. Validate a Sentence \u00b6 If you think that the sentence is qualified correctly, you just have to click on \"Validate\" to confirm that the sentence is ok.

For example, here the user indicates the destination, then the origin: @Test fun `search story asks for origin WHEN there is a destination BUT no origin in context` () { ext . send ( \"I would like to find a train\" , search ) { firstAnswer . assertText ( \"For which destination?\" ) } ext . send ( \"Lille\" , indicate_location , locationEntity setTo lille ) { firstBusAnswer . assertText ( \"For which origin?\" ) } ext . send ( \"Paris\" , indicate_location , locationEntity setTo paris ) { firstBusAnswer . assertText ( \"When?\" ) } } The first text parameter of the send method is merely indicative, to help understanding the tests.

You add custom answers using a REST API. Kotlin client and Node client are available. Connect to the demo platform \u00b6 Rather than deploying its own Tock platform, it is possible to test the WebSocket or Webhook modes directly on the Tock demo platform . Develop with Kotlin \u00b6 Enable WebSocket mode \u00b6 This is the preferred mode at startup. To use the websocket client, add the tock-bot-api-websocket dependency to your Kotlin application / project. Using Maven : <dependency> <groupId> ai.tock </groupId> <artifactId> tock-bot-api-websocket </artifactId> <version> 19.9.1 </version> </dependency> Or Gradle : compile 'ai.tock:tock-bot-api-websocket:19.9.1' Enable WebHook mode \u00b6 Alternatively, you can choose to use the WebHook client. Add the tock-bot-api-webhook dependency to your Kotlin application / project. Using Maven : <dependency> <groupId> ai.tock </groupId> <artifactId> tock-bot-api-webhook </artifactId> <version> 19.9.1 </version> </dependency> Or Gradle : compile 'ai.tock:tock-bot-api-webhook:19.9.1' In this case, unlike the WebSocket mode, the bot application must be reachable by the Tock platform and so has to expose a public URL (you can use ngrok in order to provide this URL). This URL must be specified in the webhook url field in the Configuration > Bot Configurations view of Tock Studio . Set up the API key \u00b6 In Tock Studio , after configuring a bot, go to Configuration > Bot Configurations and copy the API key of the bot to which you want to connect. You can enter / paste this key into the Kotlin code (see below). Create Stories \u00b6 The following formats are supported: Text with Buttons (Quick Replies) \"Card\" format \"Carousel\" format Specific channel formats like Messenger format, Slack format, etc. Here is a simple bot with a few stories: fun main () { startWithDemo ( newBot ( \"PUT-YOUR-TOCK-APP-API-KEY-HERE\" , // Get your app API key from Bot Configurations in Tock Studio newStory ( \"greetings\" ) { // Intent 'greetings' end ( \"Hello!\" ) // Raw text answer }, newStory ( \"location\" ) { // Intent 'location' end ( // Anwser with a card - including text, file(image, video,..) and user action suggestions newCard ( \"Card title\" , \"Card sub title\" , newAttachment ( \"https://url-image.png\" ), newAction ( \"Action 1\" ), newAction ( \"Action 2\" , \"http://redirection\" ) ) ) }, newStory ( \"goodbye\" ) { // Intent 'goodbye' end { // Answer with Messenger-specific button/quick reply buttonsTemplate ( \"Are you sure ?\" , nlpQuickReply ( \"Stay here\" )) } }, // Fallback answer when the bot does find a correct response unknownStory { end ( \"Sorry I don't understand :(\" ) } ) ) } Please consult the full source code sample . Develop in another language \u00b6 Node \u00b6 Please consult the dedicated node client documentation. API \u00b6 It is possible to develop in the language of your choice by using directly the underlying REST API. Install Bot API on your own servers \u00b6 To use Tock's Bot API mode without the demo platform, a specific module must be deployed on your own server.

You get then direct access to the MongoDb database. This mode is not available in the demo platform - you need to install the Tock docker images on your own servers. Sample Project \u00b6 A sample bot using Tock Integrated mode is provided: https://github.com/theopenconversationkit/tock-bot-open-data . It uses Open Data SNCF API (french trainlines itineraries). This is a good starting point, since it also includes a very simple NLP model. Of course, as the model is not big, the quality of the bot is low, but still it's enough to demonstrate the use of the toolkit. Docker Images \u00b6 Docker images in Docker Hub .

Sample bot based on Open Data APIs \u00b6 A docker image is available to launch it directly. The instructions are specified in the github project containing the docker images . Develop a new Bot \u00b6 Add the bot-toolkit Dependency \u00b6 The bot-toolkit dependency is required: With Maven: <dependency> <groupId> ai.tock </groupId> <artifactId> bot-toolkit </artifactId> <version> 19.9.1 </version> </dependency> With Gradle: compile 'ai.tock:bot-toolkit:19.9.1' A Bot is a Set of Stories \u00b6 This is how the open data bot is defined: val openBot = bot ( \"bot_open_data\" , stories = listOf ( greetings , departures , arrivals , search ), hello = greetings ) This bot has an unique identifier (required - \"bot_open_data\") and a list of \"Story\" . A Story is a functional subset that has a main intention and, optionally, one or more so-called \"secondary\" intentions. Here the bot defines 4 Stories , greetings, departures, arrivals and search. Greetings is also set ( hello = greetings ) as the default story used for a new dialog. A Simple Story \u00b6 How do you define a story? Here is a first simplified version of the story greetings : val greetings = story ( \"greetings\" ) { send ( \"Welcome to the Tock Open Data Bot! :)\" ) end ( \"This is a Tock framework demonstration bot: https://github.com/theopenconversationkit/tock\" ) } Note that in the body of the function, this has a BotBus type. From which you can interact with the user, and which also allows you to access to all available contextual elements. When the intention greetings will be detected by the NLP model, the function above will be called by the Tock framework. The bot sends successively a first response sentence ( bus.send() ), then a second one indicating that it is the last sentence of his answer using a bus.end() . Here is the full version of greetings : val greetings = story ( \"greetings\" ) { //cleanup state resetDialogState () send ( \"Welcome to the Tock Open Data Bot! :)\" ) send ( \"This is a Tock framework demonstration bot: https://github.com/theopenconversationkit/tock\" ) withMessenger { buttonsTemplate ( \"The bot is very limited, but ask him a route or the next departures from a station in France, and see the result! :)\" , postbackButton ( \"Itineraries\" , search ), postbackButton ( \"Departures\" , Departures ), postbackButton ( \"Arrivals\" , Arrivals ) ) } withGoogleAssistant { gaMessage ( \"The bot is very limited, but ask him a route or the next departures from a station in France, and see the result! :)\" , \"Itineraries\" , \"Departures\" , \"Arrivals\" ) } end () } Two notions have been added: resetDialogState() which cleanup the state (forgetting any previous context). the withMessenger{} and withGoogleAssistant{} methods that define specific responses for each connector - Here it's a text with buttons for Messenger, and a text with suggestions for Google Assistant. Start and Connect the Bot \u00b6 To start the bot, simply add the following call to your main function: registerAndInstallBot ( openBot ) where the openBot variable is the bot you originally defined. When the bot is started, you also need to specify which connectors are used in the web administration interface: Configuration -> Bot Configurations -> Create a new configuration See Connectors page for the list of available connectors. Advanced options \u00b6 Of course, the StoryHandler of greetings does not depend on the context: the answer is always the same. Secondary Intentions \u00b6 Here is the beginning of the definition of the search story : val search = storyDef < SearchDef >( \"search\" , otherStarterIntents = setOf ( indicate_origin ), secondaryIntents = setOf ( indicate_location )) { } The story search defines a secondary starter intent ( indicate_origin ) and a simple secondary intent ( indicate_location ). A secondary starter intent is similar in every respect to the main intent: as soon as the intent is detected, if the current story does not contain indicate_origin as secondary intent, the story search is called. For a classic secondary intent, on the other hand, the story will be executed only if the current story of the context is already the search story. Different stories can therefore share the same secondary intents. Handle Entities \u00b6 To retrieve entity values, it is good practice to define Kotlin extensions . For example here is the code used to retrieve the destination entity: val destinationEntity = openBot . entity ( \"location\" , \"destination\" ) var BotBus . destination : Place ? get () = place ( destinationEntity ) set ( value ) = setPlace ( destinationEntity , value ) private fun BotBus . place ( entity : Entity ): Place ? = entityValue ( entity , :: placeValue ) ?. place private fun BotBus . setPlace ( entity : Entity , place : Place ?) = changeEntityValue ( entity , place ?. let { PlaceValue ( place ) }) An entity of type \"location\" and role \"destination\" is created. There is a corresponding entity in the NLP model. A variable destination is defined, which will simplify the handling of this entity in the conversational code. This variable contains the current value of the destination in the user context. Here's a full version of the search story that uses destination : val search = storyDef < SearchDef >( \"search\" , setOf ( indicate_origin ), setOf ( indicate_location )) { //check mandatory entities when { destination == null -> end ( \"For which destination?\" ) origin == null -> end ( \"For which origin?\" ) departureDate == null -> end ( \"When?\" ) } } If there is no value in the current context for the destination, the bot asks to specify the destination and stays there. Same behaviour for the origin or date of departure. If the 3 required values are specified, then the real answer developed in the SearchDef class is used. Here is the full version of this first part of the code: val search = storyDef < SearchDef >( \"search\" , setOf ( indicate_origin ), setOf ( indicate_location )) { //handle generic location intent if ( isIntent ( indicate_location ) && location != null ) { if ( destination == null || origin != null ) { destination = returnsAndRemoveLocation () } else { origin = returnsAndRemoveLocation () } } //check mandatory entities when { destination == null -> end ( \"For which destination?\" ) origin == null -> end ( \"For which origin?\" ) departureDate == null -> end ( \"When?\" ) } } In the case where the detected intention is indicate_location , we do not know if the locality represents the origin or the destination. A simple rule is then used: If there is already in the context an origin and no destination, the new locality is actually the destination. Otherwise, it is the origin. HandlerDef \u00b6 In the search story above, you may have noted the generic SearchDef typing. Here is the code of this class: @GAHandler ( GASearchConnector :: class ) @MessengerHandler ( MessengerSearchConnector :: class ) class SearchDef ( bus : BotBus ) : HandlerDef < SearchConnector >( bus ) { private val d : Place = bus . destination !! private val o : Place = bus . origin !! private val date : LocalDateTime = bus . departureDate !! override fun answer () { send ( \"From {0} to {1}\" , o , d ) send ( \"Departure on {0}\" , date by datetimeFormat ) val journeys = SncfOpenDataClient . journey ( o , d , date ) if ( journeys . isEmpty ()) { end ( \"Sorry, no routes found :(\" ) } else { send ( \"Here is the first proposal:\" ) connector ?. sendFirstJourney ( journeys . first ()) end () } } } SearchDef extends HandlerDef which is an alias of a Tock framework class. It is usually here that the code of complex stories is defined. The code contains an additional abstraction: SearchConnector . SearchConnector is the class that defines the behavior specific to each connector, and the annotations @GAHandler (GASearchConnector::class) and @MessengerHandler (MessengerSearchConnector::class) indicate the corresponding implementations for the different supported connectors (respectively Google Assistant and Messenger). What would happen there is no connector for Google Assistant for example, and if a call from Google Assistant is answered? The connector?.sendFirstJourney(journeys.first()) method call would not send the final response, since connector would be null . ConnectorDef \u00b6 Here is a simplified version of SearchConnector : sealed class SearchConnector ( context : SearchDef ) : ConnectorDef < SearchDef >( context ) { fun Section . title (): CharSequence = i18n ( \"{0} - {1}\" , from , to ) fun sendFirstJourney ( journey : Journey ) = withMessage ( sendFirstJourney ( journey . publicTransportSections ())) abstract fun sendFirstJourney ( sections : List < Section >): ConnectorMessage } And its Messenger implementation: class MessengerSearchConnector ( context : SearchDef ) : SearchConnector ( context ) { override fun sendFirstJourney ( sections : List < Section >): ConnectorMessage = flexibleListTemplate ( sections . map { section -> with ( section ) { listElement ( title (), content (), trainImage ) } }, compact ) } The code specific to each connector is thus decoupled correctly. The code common to each connector is present in SearchConnector and the behavior specific to each connector is specified in the dedicated classes. StoryStep \u00b6 Sometimes you need to remember the stage at which the user is in the current story. For this, Tock provides the concept of StoryStep . There are two types of StoryStep. SimpleStoryStep \u00b6 enum class MyStep : SimpleStoryStep { a , b } val story = storyWithSteps < MyStep >( \"intent\" ) { if ( step == a ) { // ... } else if ( step == b ) { // ... } else { //default case } } To modify the current step, two methods are available: Manually change the step val story = storyWithSteps < MyStep >( \"intent\" ) { //(...) step = MyStep . a // the step will be persisted as long as we stay in this story } Use buttons or quick replies More details on this topic here . StorySteps with complex behavior \u00b6 In more complex cases, we want to be able to define a behavior for each step. enum class MySteps : StoryStep < MyHandlerDef > { //no specific behaviour display , select { // \"select\" step will be automatically selected if the select sub-intention is detected override val intent : IntentAware ? = SecondaryIntent . select override fun answer (): MyHandlerDef .() -> Any ? = { end ( \"I don't know yet how to select something\" ) } }, disruption { override fun answer (): ScoreboardDef .() -> Any ? = { end ( \"some perturbation\" ) } }; } More configuration options are available. Check out the description of StoryStep . Postback buttons & quick replies \u00b6 Messenger provides this type of button, as most connectors with GUI. With Tock, you can easily define the action performed after clicking on these buttons. In the following example, the button will redirect to the \"search\" intent: buttonsTemplate ( \"The bot is very limited! Only itineraries are supported :)\" , postbackButton ( \"Itineraries\" , search ) ) It is also possible to define a * StoryStep * and dedicated parameters: //to define parameters, just extend the ParameterKey interface enum class ChoiceParameter : ParameterKey { nextResultDate , nextResultOrigin } buttonsTemplate ( \"The bot is very limited! Only itineraries are supported :)\" , postbackButton ( \"Itineraries\" , intent = search , //if no step is specified, the current step is used step = MyStep . a , parameters = //this parameter is stored as a string (hooks are used) nextResultDate [ nextDate ] + //this parameter is stored in json (parentheses are used) nextResultOrigin ( origin ) ) ) To retrieve the parameters of the button that was clicked: val isClick = isChoiceAction () val nextDate = choice ( nextResultDate ) val nextOrigin : Locality = action . jsonChoice ( nextResultOrigin )","title":"Integrated Bot mode"},{"location":"dev/integrated-bot/#integrated-bot-mode","text":"To develop a bot or an assistant with Tock, you can also use the so called Integrated mode developed in Kotlin .

Here is the full version of this first part of the code: val search = storyDef < SearchDef >( \"search\" , setOf ( indicate_origin ), setOf ( indicate_location )) { //handle generic location intent if ( isIntent ( indicate_location ) && location != null ) { if ( destination == null || origin != null ) { destination = returnsAndRemoveLocation () } else { origin = returnsAndRemoveLocation () } } //check mandatory entities when { destination == null -> end ( \"For which destination?\" ) origin == null -> end ( \"For which origin?\" ) departureDate == null -> end ( \"When?\" ) } } In the case where the detected intention is indicate_location , we do not know if the locality represents the origin or the destination. A simple rule is then used: If there is already in the context an origin and no destination, the new locality is actually the destination. Otherwise, it is the origin.","title":"Handle Entities"},{"location":"dev/integrated-bot/#handlerdef","text":"In the search story above, you may have noted the generic SearchDef typing. Here is the code of this class: @GAHandler ( GASearchConnector :: class ) @MessengerHandler ( MessengerSearchConnector :: class ) class SearchDef ( bus : BotBus ) : HandlerDef < SearchConnector >( bus ) { private val d : Place = bus . destination !! private val o : Place = bus . origin !! private val date : LocalDateTime = bus . departureDate !! override fun answer () { send ( \"From {0} to {1}\" , o , d ) send ( \"Departure on {0}\" , date by datetimeFormat ) val journeys = SncfOpenDataClient . journey ( o , d , date ) if ( journeys . isEmpty ()) { end ( \"Sorry, no routes found :(\" ) } else { send ( \"Here is the first proposal:\" ) connector ?. sendFirstJourney ( journeys . first ()) end () } } } SearchDef extends HandlerDef which is an alias of a Tock framework class. It is usually here that the code of complex stories is defined. The code contains an additional abstraction: SearchConnector . SearchConnector is the class that defines the behavior specific to each connector, and the annotations @GAHandler (GASearchConnector::class) and @MessengerHandler (MessengerSearchConnector::class) indicate the corresponding implementations for the different supported connectors (respectively Google Assistant and Messenger). What would happen there is no connector for Google Assistant for example, and if a call from Google Assistant is answered?

Important : this platform is not supposed to host bots in production. This is merely a sandbox instance, in order to try the Tock solution without installing it. A login dialog invites you to connect with GitHub. Only your account ID will be read from GitHub. Create a Tock application \u00b6 When accessing the demo platform for the first time, a wizard helps to create the first application : Enter a name for the application Select a language - other languages can be added later Validate to create the application The just-created application is now visible from the menu: Configuration > NLU Applications . Once the first application has been created, you can create others using Create New Application . Add a connector \u00b6 To interact with the bot (through a communication channel), a connector must be used. Numerous connectors are provided with Tock: Messenger , WhatsApp , Google Assistant and Google Home , Twitter , Alexa , Business Chat , Teams , Slack , Rocket.Chat ... It is even possible to implement your own connectors to integrate with more channels. In this tutorial, you will configure a connector for Slack - the collaborative and instant messaging platform. It will be possible to try the bot using the Tock Studio interface - no need to use Slack or get an account. Create the first connector for your application: Go to Configuration > Bot Configurations Create a new Configuration Select the connector type Slack Enter anything e.g. token in Token fields (for the moment) Create Note that an API Key is automatically generated for the application, once the first connector is created. This key is required to connect to the bot API, in order to leverage the WebHook or WebSocket modes. Clicking on Display test configurations , you can see another Test configuration has been created. This connector is used when the bot is tested directly through the Tock Studio interface. It allows to try the bot without having Slack, for instance. Create a story \u00b6 A conversational bot receives and understands user sentences, using natural-language techniques to identify an intent and possibly entities . Example: from the sentence \"What will the weather be like tomorrow?\", the Tock NLU (Natural Language Understanding) engine should detect a \"weather\" intent and a \"tomorrow\" date/time entity precising the question (like a kind of intent variable/parameter). In order to detect intents and entities, sentences must first be added and qualifieds. The Tock NLU menu allows to manage intents and entities, qualify sentences and supervise the bot training: the more qualified sentences, the more relevant is the bot . Nevertheless, let's leave intents and entities for now... The Tock Stories mode allows to create intents automatically in a few minutes, as well as the expected answers. You will now create a first template of a conversation, using the Tock Studio graphical tools: Go to Build > New Story Enter a new user sentence - for instance \"hello\" A form now opens to configure the new story creation, the intent, the type of response, etc. In the Add new Answer field, enter the answer - for instance \"what a nice day!\" End with Create Story Test the bot \u00b6 It is time to try the bot and its first story! Go to Test > Test the bot Say \"hello\", the bot answers Please check that the correct application and language are selected (in case there are more than one) when testing: they are visible in the top-right corner of the interface. Improve the understanding \u00b6 By entering various sentences through the Test the bot interface, you can see it does not understand much your phrases - even with sentences very similar to the one at story creation. The conversational model and the Tock NLU engine must be trained and improved by progressively adding user qualified sentences to feed underlying algorithms and give more and more relevant results. Although first tries can be deceiving, several qualified sentences (one or two dozens if necessary) usually make a difference and the bot gets more relevant. Go to NLU > Inbox Here you can see the previously entered sentences, and more interestingly how the bot qualified them. For each sentence, Tock shows the detected intent, the language, as well as the scores (given by the algorithms according to their level of confidence for the sentence). Choose several sentences, for each one: select the correct intent then Validate Return to Test > Test the bot Check the bot now understands these sentences correctly, as well as slightly-different ones you have never entered! Create more stories (optional) \u00b6 To go a little further with Tock stories , you could create more stories and test them directly from Tock Studio . Each bot response comes from the intent detected/triggered, without another form of navigation than the thread of YOUR sentences. Conversational is magic: natural language is the navigation, users are not forced to use traditional links and menus anymore (contrary to Websites and mobile apps). For curious users, let's have a word about managing numerous stories and the possible impact on understanding. If you take time and create many stories , you may experience unintended effects with how work NLU models and algorithms. As an example, numerous intents and entities can make detection difficult (or more random). A general recommendation is to create bots, dedicated to a limited functional perimeter. It makes it easier to train each bot and focus on the model for its own domain. Qualifying a lot of sentences generally improves the bot understanding, however too many sentences (or too similar) can over-train the model for an intent, resulting in degraded performance. As a conclusion, remember the design and maintenance of conversational models is complex, it requires training (the bot, as well as people building it), qualifying and adapting the models on a regular basis to user needs and language. Congratulations! \u00b6 You have just created your first conversational application with Tock.
