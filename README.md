## Using Pre-commit

This project uses **pre-commit** to automate code checks and formatting before each commit, ensuring consistent code quality and reducing errors.<br/>
It is very important to always execute these hooks to maintain the quality of the code.

### Installation
1. Install `pre-commit`:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```
2. Set up the hooks in your repository:
   ```bash
    pre-commit install
   ```
### Usage

Hooks will run automatically on each commit.<br/>
To run them manually on all files, use:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
